    "# Chemical Potential in Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical potential is the energy difference between two observable situations. Like the energy difference between you on a rooftop and on the ground.That energy can be calculated. It can be accessed by allowing the system to proceed toward its destination. Just jump. The potential energy will be released as heat (although some of the energy will have been used to break your bones.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of potential energy, standard and observed. Standard potential energy is the nergy difference between two situations in the standard state. For that rooftop example we might always use a standard mass. For chemistry, we use standard concentrations and the standard state is when all reactants and products are present in a concentration of 1 mole/L.\n",

    "We have seen that free energy in a situation depends on the standard free energy difference combined with the actual concentrations in the real world (no system ever has all concentrations at 1 M). The potential energy held back by a membrane is the same as the potential energy held back by the floor you are standing on. You want to fall down, but the floor is holding you at a given altitude. Molecules want to flow from greater to lesser concentrations but can be held back by a barrier.\n",

We use the same free energy equation as above. But $\\Delta G \\degree = 0$ for membranes becasue the molecule is not changing, only ist concentrations. The concentration term of the equation will be all that matters.\n",
