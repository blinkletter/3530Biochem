# Data Interpretation and Modelling for Biochemistry

In the tutorial we will be examining experimental data an interpreting it with mathematical models (e.g. curve fits). We will be using a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel and we will use Python. The is not a programming course and we will not be using Python as a program language. We will be using it as a calculator, a graphing calculator.
