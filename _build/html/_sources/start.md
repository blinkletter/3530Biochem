# Data Interpretation for Biochemistry

In the tutorial we will be examining experimental data an interpreting it with mathematical models (e.g. curve fits). We will be using a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft *Excel* and we will use *Python*. The is not a programming course and we will not be using *Python* as a program language. We will be using it as a calculator, a graphing calculator.

By then end of this course you will have solved problems with both *Python* and *Excel*. After this experience you will then choose your path in life. Will you be a Microsoft person or a *Python* person? Only you can decide. Choose wisely.

## How to Use this Book

This set of web pages is dedicated to the *Python* part of our data exercises. Each page is a web version of a *Python* interactive notebook (a .ipynb file). You will be able to see the *Python* code and the result of each block of code. To use the notebook itself, click on the Google *Colab* icon (a little rocket ship) and go to the *Colab* web site where you will be able to run the *Python* code via the web.

## Steal This Code

This is not a programming course. Feel free to steal and reuse any code that you find useful. Help each other by sharing your code once you get it working. Understanding the math and being able to discuss your interpretation of results is the key skill that we are trying to reinforce. The code is just a tool. You don't have to write code, but you should work to be able to understand what a given set of *Python* commands are doing and be able to make small changes to suit your purpose.

When you steal code always give credit (to these pages, to a fellow student, to StackOverflow or ChatGPT). Your written prose if for me and must be your own work but the code is merely a tool and I care not how you put it together.

Almost all the code you will need for this course will be contained within *Python* notebooks that I will make available to you in the links below. Steal it all. You will have to make some small adjustments in my code when you use it for your own. 

If you should fall in love with *Python*, I recommend ['Scientific Computing for Chemists' by Charles Weiss](https://weisscharlesj.github.io/SciCompforChemists/notebooks/introduction/intro.html)

## Tutorial 2

In our second tutorial meeting we will be doing basic acid equilibrium problems. We could use a calculator, but that leaves no record of what we did. We would not be able to find our error. We could use a spreadsheet application and that file would contain all our calculations. We will also try using an interactive *Python* notebook. The following links will take you to the *Python* notebooks for this tutorial.

- [Acid Equilibria with *Python*](T02/T2_AcidBaseMath.ipynb)

This notebook features a few starter code blocks that will solve acid/base equilibria problems. We will demonstrate using both *Excel* and *Python* as a self-documenting calculator.

- [Problem Set Examples](T02/T2_Exercise.ipynb)

This notebook provides *Python* code for solving some of the problems in the 'Math Ideas' problem set. Steal this code as you work on the other problems. 

- [Modeling Titrations](T02/T2_TitrModel.ipynb)

This notebook provides *Python* code plotting titrations of weak acids like acetic acid. It is not something that I want you to be able to do. I will be using this to provide a graphical interpretation of buffer behaviour.

## Tutorial 3

In our third tutorial meeting we will be exporing enzyme kinetics. We will observe the consequences of inhibitors and have some fun curve fitting plots.

- [Inhibitors in Action](T03/T3_MM_Intro_fun.ipynb)

Change the dissociation constants for inhibitors and see what happens.

- [The Abominable Plot](T03/T3_MM_Intro_basics.ipynb)

Solve a textbook problem while exploring just how bad the lineweaver-Burke plot is. There are better options.
